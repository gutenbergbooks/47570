<blockquote>
<p>To the ornithologist who may be so fortunate as to visit Southern California in the
spring, when Nature has put on her holiday attire, and everything appears at its best,
our friends, the feathered midgets, will contribute not a little to the pleasure of his stay.

<p>The Black-chinned Hummingbird has
a long and narrow range extending along
the Pacific coast from Southern British
Columbia southward into Southern Mexico,
where it passes the winter. Eastward
its range extends to Western Montana,
Western Colorado, New Mexico,
and Western Texas. In some portions
of this range it is very abundant,
while in others that are apparently as
well suited to its habits it is rare, or
never seen at all.</p>
<p>This Hummingbird, which also bears
the name Purple-throated and Alexandre&rsquo;s
Hummingbird, is very similar in
its habits to our eastern ruby-throat.
Even in its call notes and antics while
wooing its mate it is almost a counterpart
of the eastern species.</p>
<p>Next to the Anna&rsquo;s hummingbird, the
Black-chinned is the most conspicuous of
all the hummingbirds that frequent southern
California. At twilight it is a frequent
visitor to the orange groves, and
later, as night approaches, it retires to the
mountain sides, where, with numerous
individuals of its own kind and other
birds, it finds a resting place through
the dark hours.</p>
<p>Mr. B. T. Gault has related an interesting
anecdote that occurred in his experience
with hummingbirds. He once
found a nest of the Black-chinned species
in which there were eggs nearly ready to
hatch. Wishing the nest, which was an
exceedingly fine one, he cut the branch
only to find the eggs of no value as
specimens. Finally, finding a nest in
which there were two fresh eggs, he
took them and substituted the two older
ones. The female bird watched this
action from a nearby branch. Returning
a few days later, he was surprised
to find two little naked worm-like bodies
in the nest. Naturally satisfied and
pleased over the result of his experiment
he says: &ldquo;The old bird seemed pleased
too, as she watched me from a neighboring
branch, while arranging her feathers,
evidently wondering why I should take
such a deep interest in her treasures.
And well she might be pleased, for incubation
had been robbed of all its tediousness
in this case and the pair acting
on this assumption undoubtedly hatched
another brood, but not in such haste,
I venture to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nests are delicate affairs, and in
many cases resemble small sponges, readily
assuming their normal form if the
edges are pressed together. The inner
cup is seldom more than one inch in
diameter. The walls are usually composed
of the down of willows. This is
firmly woven by an unsparing use of
spider web. Usually a few small leaves
and scales of willow buds are attached
to the outer face, evidently to give it
stability.</p>
<p>It has been stated that hummingbirds
invariably lay but two eggs in each set.
The female Black-chinned Hummingbird
seems to be at least one of the exceptions
that prove the rule. Major Bendire says
that &ldquo;nests of this species now and then
contain three eggs, all evidently laid by
the same female, and such instances do
not appear to be especially rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Black-chinned Hummingbird is
like all the other birds of its kind. Always
inquisitive, never afraid to combat
a foe and always active, the lines of
Jones Very are especially applicable to
its character:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like thoughts that flitted across the mind,</p>
<p class="t0">Leaving no lasting trace behind,</p>
<p class="t0">The humming-bird darts to and fro,</p>
<p class="t0">Comes, vanishes before we know.</p>

<h2 id="c4">THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF AN ANTELOPE.</h2>
<p>I cannot tell you the exact date of
my birth. As I was separated from my
mother at a very early age, this lack of
knowledge on my part, I think, should
be excused. But Polly has often told
me it was the second day of April, 1866,
that I came into her possession.</p>
<p>On that particular morning the wind
was very high and had a stinging bite in
it and my mother, after giving me my
breakfast, left me nestled down in a
bunch of tall, dry grass, and went out
for her own breakfast.</p>
<p>I soon fell asleep. How long I had
slept I do not know, when I was suddenly
aroused from my comfortable nap
by a large, dark animal snorting right
over me. Of course, I was very much
frightened and wished my mother would
come to me. If I had not been so shaky
on my legs I would have run away in
search of her, but my feet had an uncomfortable
way of getting too far apart,
and my body seemed entirely too heavy
for my legs; so I lay very still, hoping
that this strange object might pass on
and not disturb me. But a few moments
later there bent over me what I
soon after learned was a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is a baby antelope.
There&mdash;don&rsquo;t struggle so, or you
will break your pipe-stem legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon I found that it was useless for
me to try to free myself from his grasp,
for while he was not at all rough, he
held me quite firmly. Then I began to
shiver from fear; also from the cold
wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little fellow&mdash;he is cold,&rdquo; the
man said, soothingly, and he took a
blanket from the pommel of his saddle
and wrapped it around me. Then, mounting
his horse, with me still in his arms,
we set out across the prairie. After about
half an hour he stopped at a gate, where
there were several log cabins huddled
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly! Come here, Polly!&rdquo; the man
called, and a little flaxen-haired girl
came running from one of the cabins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, papa?&rdquo; she called, as she
opened the heavy gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a new pet for you&mdash;a baby antelope,&rdquo;
and he handed me down to her.</p>
<p>Polly put me on the ground and lifted
the blanket from around me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the funny little darling!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;Papa, he is all legs and spots,
and&mdash;and ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man replied; &ldquo;he will soon
lose his spots, but his legs and ears will
stay with him, and it won&rsquo;t be very long
until he will show you how he can use
those long legs of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man rode away, and Polly carried
me into the house, where everybody handled
and looked at me, all of which made
me feel forlorn indeed. But when Polly
put me into a box half full of nice, clean
hay, in a sunny nook between two of the
cabins, I felt that the best thing for me
to do was to lie down and go to sleep.</p>
<p>After a comfortable nap I awoke, feeling
very hungry, and began to call feebly
for my mother. But it was Polly, henceforth
my foster mother and beloved
friend, that came in answer to my call.
She carried me into the kitchen, where
a bottle, with a quill wrapped with a soft
rag for a stopper, was standing by the
fire. Polly took the bottle and put the
stopper into my mouth. The rag was
not pleasant to my taste, and the quill,
although disguised by many soft wrappings,
was hard and unyielding. Naturally,
I objected, but Polly persisted, and
after a while I got a taste of the warm
milk that flowed through the quill. Then
I ceased to struggle and proceeded to
take my dinner in the only way I knew.</p>
<p>At an early age I was taught to eat
cornmeal and wheat bran, both of which
I liked very much.</p>
<p>Soon the yard became entirely too
small for me. I longed to go outside,
where there was room for me to use my
legs, and I got to watching for the gate
to be opened. Polly noticed my desire
to get outside the gate, and one day
when I was standing near it, looking out
through a crack in the fence, she came
and put her arms around my neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lopez,&rdquo; and her voice had a note of
sadness in it that I had never heard before,
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
&ldquo;it is because I love you so that I
keep you shut up in this yard. A big,
wicked panther lives near here, and he
might carry you off, just as he did my
little lamb. I never told you about it
before, because I did not want to make
you feel sad, and&mdash;and, Lopez, I thought
maybe you would feel jealous if you
knew how much I had cared for something
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to make her understand that I
was not in the least jealous of the dead
lamb; also that the fact that a panther
lived near the ranch did not alarm me.
I longed for freedom&mdash;glorious freedom&mdash;and
felt that there was no animal
of the plains that I would not willingly
enter the lists against in a foot race.</p>
<p>One bright morning, soon after this,
Polly&rsquo;s father opened the gate, at the
same time saying to her, &ldquo;I am going to
turn Lopez out for a little while this
morning and let him stretch his legs and
eat some grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;he will run
away, and the panther will catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; her father replied; &ldquo;he will
come back, and you need not fear the
panther at this time of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caution is one of the characteristic
traits of my family, so I approached the
open gate slowly and stood looking out
for a few moments. The ranch is situated
on the bank of a small stream, which
here swings around, forming a deep
crescent. Lying within the loop, between
the stream and a low range of hills,
which just above the house flattens down
to a ridge, is a lovely valley, level as a
floor, and perhaps a mile and a half in
length. At the widest point it is not
over three-quarters of a mile wide and
narrows down to a point at each end of
the crescent. When I saw this beautiful
playground my heart leaped with
joy, and I sprang away with the fleetness
of the wind. When I had tired myself
out running around the valley I
came back to Polly, who still stood by
the open gate.</p>
<p>After this Polly allowed me to go out
every morning, and again late in the afternoon;
and a little later I had perfect
freedom, going and coming when it
pleased me. I never stayed out at night,
however, and but seldom went beyond
the beautiful valley, which was my playground.</p>
<p>One warm day in midsummer Polly
and her father came out to the live-oak
tree by the gate, in the dense shade of
which I usually took my noon nap. Polly
was carrying her little work basket and
some bright red ribbon. Her father had
a strap of leather and a small bright
buckle. I got up at once and went to
them, curious to know what they were
going to do, besides the scarlet ribbon
was very attractive. I soon saw that
they were making me a collar. The
strap was measured to fit my neck and
then covered with the ribbon. Then the
buckle was put on and a very large bow
of ribbon, which showed off handsomely
against the white of my neck and breast,
finished the collar.</p>
<p>Soon after I learned the utility of this
collar. It was early morning, and I had
gone over the ridge and was quietly
feeding. Suddenly I raised my head
and saw a man, not fifty yards away,
with his gun leveled toward me. I
looked at him very straight, and he lowered
his gun and went away. My bright
collar had saved my life.</p>
<p>One bright November day I had gone
to the top of the hill and was looking
away over that beautiful plain, when
Polly came and stood by me, her hand
resting gently on my neck. Suddenly
the thought came to me that it would be
a fine thing for Polly and I to go away
and live on the plains. What a free and
happy life we would lead! We probably
would find other antelopes, and Polly
in time might learn to run as fast as I.</p>
<p>As this idea took shape, I determined
to try it at once. So, without giving
Polly any warning, I sprang away and
ran a short distance, then turned around
and invited her to come on. She, thinking
that I wanted to romp, came after
me; but when she could almost touch
me, I ran away as before, and again she
came after me, laughing with glee. This
maneuver I repeated several times, all
the time going further out on the prairie.
At last Polly stopped and looked back.
Then, to divert her attention, I put forth
all my efforts to draw her into a romp.
First, by running around her in a circle,
and then stopping near her to jump up
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
and down with my legs very stiff. This
always amused her greatly, and it succeeded
this time. She laughed and ran
after me, trying to catch me, but I
dodged first one way and then the other,
just allowing her fingers to touch me,
then slipping away from her, but all the
time going further out on the prairie.
At last Polly grew tired and stopped to
look around her. She gave a little gurgling
cry of terror that brought me to
her side at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lopez!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Lopez, I
don&rsquo;t know the way home. It all looks
alike, and I have forgotten which way
we came.&rdquo; She clasped her arms around
my neck and cried bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lopez!&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
know the way home? You know, animals
are smarter about such things than
little girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did know the way perfectly well, and
Polly&rsquo;s grief hurt me so that I was
strongly tempted to lead her straight
back to the ranch; but I reasoned that
it had cost me considerable effort to get
her this far, and why should I now turn
back? Besides, to me, there was no reason
why Polly should not be perfectly
happy in this new and free life, when
she should become accustomed to it.
And why should she not adapt herself to
my mode of life as easily as I had myself
to hers?</p>
<p>Reasoning thus, I deliberately started
in the opposite direction to the ranch,
walking slowly, with Polly by my side.</p>
<p>Thus we wandered on for perhaps an
hour, then I stopped to graze, and Polly
sank down on the grass to rest. But
soon she sprang up, saying: &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t
do, Lopez; we must go on and try to
find home. Just see how low the sun
is.&rdquo; And then she began to cry.</p>
<p>We had started out early in the afternoon,
and the warm sunshine made the
air very comfortable. Now the sun
hung, a great red ball, just above the
dark line that marked the union of sky
and plain, and the chill of evening was
fast coming on. We wandered on, apparently
the only living creatures on this
vast plain&mdash;on and on, until the last ray
of sunlight had been swallowed up by
the dusk of evening. The sky was
thickly dotted with glittering, twinkling
stars, and still we wandered on. A band
of white appeared just above the eastern
horizon, quickly followed by the
moon, which filled the lonely plain with
the softened glory of its light, and still
we wandered on.</p>
<p>After what seemed to me a very long
time, Polly sank down by a bunch of tall
grass, and I lay down close by her side.
She slipped her hand through my collar
and soon fell asleep. As the night
grew colder, Polly nestled closer to me,
and as we had a thick bed of dry grass
we were tolerably warm.</p>
<p>Polly slept quietly, and now I, too,
fell asleep, and was only awakened by
the broad light of day.</p>
<p>I got up and went to grazing near
where Polly was lying still asleep. Soon
I saw a wolf go from the carcass of a
dead cow to a pool of water and drink.
Being quite thirsty, as soon as the wolf
had gone away I went to the pool myself
and drank. Then, thinking Polly might
be thirsty, too, I went back to her and
rubbed my nose against her face to wake
her. She sat up and looked around her
in a dazed sort of way for a few minutes,
then stood up and strained her
eyes, first in one direction and then in
another. At last she turned to me, and
I could see that her lips were quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lopez, I think there is water where
those small trees are growing; anyway,
we will go and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we reached the pool Polly knelt
down and drank, and then gathered and
ate several handfuls of red haws from
the scrubby little trees that grew around
the pool. We then started on, walking as
fast as Polly could.</p>
<p>We had gone on for perhaps two
hours, when I insisted upon stopping to
eat some more grass. Polly pulled at my
collar. &ldquo;Oh, Lopez, come on,&rdquo; she said,
a little crossly. &ldquo;If I can do without
something to eat, surely you can, too.&rdquo;
But I would not go, and she sat down
in the grass to wait for me.</p>
<p>When we started on again I noticed
that Polly was shivering. The sun had
disappeared behind a misty veil of clouds
and it was much colder than it had been
in the early morning. Later in the day
we came to a deep ravine. A few pecan
trees grew along its banks, and here
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
Polly gathered some of the fallen nuts
and ate them, while I ate my dinner of
grass.</p>
<p>We found a place where a smooth
trail crossed the gully. This we followed
until it broadened out and was
lost in the prairie grass.</p>
<p>The sky was now a dull slate color,
and little feathery flakes of snow were
falling. I could see a dark streak in the
distance, which I knew must be timber.
Instinct taught me that here we should
find shelter, and towards this we were
hurrying. Little drifts of snow were
gathering in Polly&rsquo;s flaxen hair, and her
hands were purple from cold. She stumbled
often, sometimes quite falling down,
but she would get up and struggle on.
The timber still seemed a great way off,
when Polly stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use for me to try, Lopez,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go any further. You
will have to go on alone,&rdquo; and she sank
down into the snowy grass.</p>
<p>Now, this was a terrible fix to be in.
The storm was growing worse every
minute, and I knew that it must be almost
night. I would run around Polly
and stamp my feet, then rub my nose
against her face, trying to persuade her
to get up and go on, but she would only
say, &ldquo;Poor Lopez, I can&rsquo;t go any further.&rdquo;
After awhile she would not notice
me; then I knew she was asleep.</p>
<p>A feeling of despair was coming over
me, when I saw two men, riding toward
the timber. I ran out, so that I was directly
in their path, and stood facing
them, stamping my feet. It was evident
that they were watching me with some
interest, and when they were near me
the older of the two exclaimed, &ldquo;Why,
that is Polly Vinson&rsquo;s pet antelope. Rope
him, Bob, and we will take him home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man loosened a coil of
rope from the pommel of his saddle and
began to swing a loop above his head;
but before the loop could descend I
sprang away and ran to where Polly
was lying, now almost covered with
snow. The two men started on, and I
ran round and round and stamped my
feet. I was almost frantic.</p>
<p>They stopped again, and the younger
one came to us. He got off his horse
and bent over Polly, then turned and
called to his companion, who was now
coming toward us:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dawson, here is little Polly herself,
and I fear she is dead.&rdquo; He lifted
Polly up and shook her, rather roughly,
I thought. &ldquo;Polly! Polly!&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;wake up and tell me how you came
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly opened her eyes and sleepily
looked at the young man. &ldquo;Oh, Mr.
Bob,&rdquo; she said wearily, &ldquo;Lopez and I
are lost. Won&rsquo;t you please take us
home?&rdquo; Then she leaned her head
against him and closed her eyes again.</p>
<p>He quickly pulled off his overcoat and
wrapped it around Polly, and handed
her up to the older man. Then, tying
the end of his rope through my collar
he mounted his horse, when we started
swiftly toward the timber. To be tied
was an indignity that I had never before
submitted to, but now I was so
glad to have some help with Polly that
I made no resistance.</p>
<p>Very soon were were at the Dawson
ranch. Indeed, Polly and I, without
knowing it, had been going straight to
the ranch, and were not more than
a mile away when she gave out and
went to sleep in the snow.</p>
<p>When Polly was warm and had eaten
something, Mr. Dawson put her to bed,
and Mr. Bob took me to the warm
kitchen, where I had a nice supper of
wheat bran. While I was eating Mr.
Dawson came to the kitchen and patted
me on the neck. &ldquo;Brave Lopez,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you saved the life of your little
mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few minutes the young man
stood up. &ldquo;Mr. Dawson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
am going to ride to Vinson&rsquo;s to-night
and let him know that his child is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried Mr. Dawson, &ldquo;ride ten
miles through this storm? You must
not think of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the young man, quietly,
&ldquo;I shall go. Blackbird will carry me
there safely, and I shall only be doing
as I would be done by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later I heard him ride away,
and then I went to sleep.</p>

<br />(Speotyto cunicularia hypogaea.)
<br />&frac12; Life-size.
<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. CHI. ACAD. SCIENCES.</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c5">THE BURROWING OWL.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Speotyto cunicularia hypogaea.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Burrowing Owl is a denizen of the
prairies and plains west of the Mississippi
and the Missouri rivers. It is
found from localities somewhat north
of the United States as far to the southward
as Guatemala. In some parts of
this large area it is exceedingly common,
and it is the only representative of the
owl tribe that inhabits, in any numbers at
least, the treeless regions of the western
states.</p>
<p>Unlike other species of owls, the Burrowing
Owl is especially fitted for a subterranean
mode of life. It will make its
home in the burrows of the various animals
that inhabit the prairie regions.
These birds are social and live in colonies
consisting of several pairs. Some
Indians have claimed that it retires into
its burrow at the approach of winter, and
there remains in a torpid condition during
the cold weather. Careful observers
have, however, shown that this is not the
case. It may be said that, except in the
northern part of its range, where the winters
are severe, it is resident wherever
found and not migratory. It is probable
that it would not be migratory at all were
it not that the animals upon which it
feeds are not obtainable in severe weather.
Investigation has proved that the
stories of the confidential relations existing
between the Burrowing Owl, the
prairie dog and the rattlesnake are pure
fabrications of an imaginative mind,
greatly strengthened by additions as they
are passed from person to person. The
only foundation for these stories is the
fact that this Owl and also the rattlesnake
do occasionally enter the burrows of the
prairie dog. Dr. Coues has said &ldquo;that the
Owls live at ease in the settlements and
on familiar terms with their four-footed
neighbors is an undoubted fact; but that
they inhabit the same burrows or have
any intimate domestic relations is quite
another thing. It is no proof that the
quadrupeds and the birds live together
that they are often seen to scuttle at each
other&rsquo;s heels into the same hole when
alarmed, for in such a case the two
simply seek the nearest shelter independently
of each other.&rdquo; It is not at all
strange that the snakes should also enter
these holes. It may be that they do so
for the want of some other retreat on a
broad expanse of prairie, but it is much
more probable that they are in search of
food, either in the form of young dogs or
the eggs of the Owl. Though the Burrowing
Owls are found with the burrowing
mammals, they do not occupy the
same holes with them and do without
doubt drive them out if they wish to pre-empt
the burrows for their own use.</p>
<p>Though the Burrowing Owl probably
obtains most of its food in the early twilight,
it is frequently &ldquo;in motion on the
brightest days, capturing its prey or
evading its pursuer with the greatest
ease.&rdquo; Like the sparrowhawk, it frequently
hovers in the air and drops upon
its prey. Its food consists of the smaller
rodents, including the young of the prairie
dog, frogs, fish, lizards, snakes and insects
of various kinds. In fact, its food
is so varied and consists of noxious animals
to so great an extent that it is of
great service to the agriculturist. Dr.
Fisher says: &ldquo;In summer and fall, when
grasshoppers and crickets are exceedingly
abundant on the western plains, the
Burrowing Owl feeds almost exclusively
on such food. Like the sparrowhawk,
this little Owl will chase and devour
grasshoppers until its stomach is distended
to the utmost.&rdquo; It is rare and
only when pressed for food that it attacks
and kills other birds.</p>
<p>Dr. C. S. Canfield gives the following
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
account of its nesting habits: &ldquo;I once
took pains to dig out a nest of the Burrowing
Owl. I found the burrow was
about four feet long and the nest was
only about two feet from the surface of
the ground. The nest was made in a cavity
of the ground, of about a foot in diameter,
well filled with dry, soft horse-dung,
bits of an old blanket and the fur of a
coyote that I had killed a few days before.
One of the parent birds was on
the nest, and I captured it. It had no intention
of leaving the nest, even when entirely
uncovered with shovel and exposed
to the open air. It fought bravely with
beak and claws. I found seven young
ones, perhaps eight or ten days old, well
covered with down, but without any
feathers. The whole nest, as well as
the birds, swarmed with fleas. It was
the filthiest nest I ever saw. There are
few birds that carry more rubbish into
the nest than the Burrowing Owls, and
even the vultures are not more filthy.&rdquo;
In this nest Dr. Canfield found scraps of
dead animals, both of mammals, snakes
and insects.</p>
<p>Major Bendire believes that when these
Owls are once mated they are paired for
life. He also likens their love-note,
which is heard about sundown, to the call
of the English cuckoo. He says that it is
&ldquo;a mellow, sonorous and far-reaching
&lsquo;coo-c-oo,&rsquo; the last syllables somewhat
drawn out, and this concert is kept up
for an hour or more. These notes are
only uttered when the bird is at rest, sitting
on the little hillock surrounding the
burrow. While flying about a chattering
sort of note is used and when alarmed
a short shrill &lsquo;tzip-tzip.&rsquo; When wounded
and enraged it utters a shrill scream and
snaps its mandibles rapidly together,
making a sort of rattling noise, throws itself
on its back, ruffles its feathers and
strikes out vigorously with its talons, and
with which it can inflict quite a severe
wound.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c7">THE WESTERN PINE SQUIRREL.</h2>
<p>Many peculiar things have been written
about the red squirrel, or what is
called out west, the Pine Squirrel. These
frisky little animals are found in great
numbers throughout eastern Washington.
The northern part of eastern Washington
abounds in pine forests, and those
regions are a favorite abode for the squirrel.</p>
<p>Next to the large silver fox squirrel
and the diminutive chipmunk, the Pine
Squirrel is the most handsome, graceful
and interesting member of that numerous
family found in the Northwest. He is
a bright, sprightly little fellow. During
the long, bright, sunny days of spring,
summer and autumn, the Pine Squirrel
makes his home out of doors. His life
seems to be one of perpetual sunshine
and pleasure.</p>
<p>From early dawn to dusk the Pine
Squirrel is on the move. He is never
still for an instant. You see him scampering
up and down the great trunk of a
pine, fir or tamarack. Next, he is out on
the tip end of a long, swaying branch.
Then he is on the ground. The next instant
he is running along the body of
some prostrate tree.</p>
<p>He is full of curiosity. If you stand
and watch him, he will return the compliment
with interest. If you are perfectly
still, the little chap will venture
close and eye you very sharply. He is
as quick as a flash, and if you chance
to move, away he darts, uttering his peculiar,
sharp, chattering call.</p>
<p>Rarely will you see him without something
in his mouth. He is very dainty,
however, as to what he eats. For all
that he lives in the trees and on the
ground, yet the Pine Squirrel has a permanent
home. When chilling frosts visit
the earth and the snow softly descends,
the little fellow whisks away to his hole.
However, he does not hibernate, like the
bear. Not he. Often during the winter
the squirrel will come out and take a
view of the upper world. But this he
does only when the weather is fine. He
never shows himself when it is bitter
cold and when storms prevail.</p>
<p>The Pine Squirrel leads no butterfly
existence. He has the prudent forethought
of the ant. He enjoys life and
sports in the sunshine, but all the while
he is carefully storing away a good supply
of food to tide him over the winter.
His home is generally well selected and
his bed is soft and warm. He knows
what comfort means. However, this
Squirrel has some queer ways. In some
parts of northeastern Washington there
are a great many mushrooms and toadstools.
The Pine Squirrel will spend
days in gathering these peculiar growths
and carrying them away, but not to his
hole. He will carry some of them high
up into trees and place them in the forks
of branches, where the wind cannot shake
them out.</p>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of these fungi
will be placed in the forks of tall saplings,
bushes, shrubs and even weeds.
Some of the toadstools are larger than
the squirrel himself, but, like the ant,
he will keep tugging away, and finally
the little fellow will land them where he
wishes to have them placed.</p>
<p>So far as known, the Squirrel never
eats the fungi. He does not take any
to his hole, and after placing the toadstools
in the brush he does not disturb
them again. The fungi dries away and
may be seen for several years. What instinct
prompts the little creature to do
this, is a mystery. I have never yet found
any naturalist, trapper, hunter or frontiersman
who could give a satisfactory
explanation of the matter.</p>
<p>The wood rat and magpie will steal
every imaginable article about a house,
carry it away and secrete it. Most of
these articles can not be eaten and are
of no possible use to the rat or bird. Perhaps
the Pine Squirrel is prompted by a
similar instinct.</p>
<p>The Western Pine Squirrel is a perfectly
harmless and peaceable animal.
He is not known to attack any other animal
except the weasel, and then only in
self-defense.</p>

<h2 id="c8">THE AUDUBON&rsquo;S WARBLER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Dendroica auduboni.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Audubon&rsquo;s Warbler bears the same relation
to the Western United States that
the myrtle warbler bears to the Eastern
States. It inhabits the forests and thickets
of the West from British Columbia
southward as far as Guatemala in winter.
And, as Dr. Coues has stated, it has
rarely been known to pass to the eastward
beyond the line of arboreal vegetation,
which marks the easternmost foothills
and outlying elevations of the Rocky
Mountains.</p>
<p>During its migrations it is often associated
with the titmouse and the ruby-crowned
kinglet. It may be seen skipping
about in the tree tops, actively engaged
in searching for insects, which it
will at times pursue in the air. It may
be readily distinguished from the myrtle
warbler, which it so closely resembles
both in habits and actions, by its yellow
instead of white throat, which is characteristic
of the myrtle warbler.</p>
<p>Its nest is usually built in cone-bearing
trees at a variable altitude of from three
to thirty feet. These homes are neatly
woven and usually constructed of fine
strips of bark, pine needles and twigs.
They are lined with fine roots, bark
fibers, hair and feathers. In Colorado
it is known to breed on the mountain
sides at an altitude of nine or ten thousand
feet.</p>
<p>The habits of this little warbler are
well portrayed by Mrs. Whitman:</p>

<h2 id="c10">SPRING NOTES FROM FEATHERED THROATS.
<br /><span class="small">IN NEW JERSEY.</span></h2>
<p>That individual unaffected by the first
fluttering wings of returning spring migrants
is an anomaly indeed. He must
ever have been secluded beyond reach of
trill or glint of the feathery kingdom,
or else is pitifully invulnerable to one of
nature&rsquo;s chiefest charms. For who, having
listened to the enraptured love-notes
and witnessed the extravagant devotion,
intermingled with drollest buffoonery,
during the progress of some field or forest
courtship, is beyond feeling interest
and pleasure in these half-human and
wholly unique performances? Or who
has not felt a thrill of admiration, to be
followed by one of commiseration, when
one of the hunters of the air made his
terrific plunge, hurtling down like an animated
catapult, to strike his quarry ere it
found cover in wood or thicket? To all
those having formed some degree of bird
companionship and who live where winter
robs them of those friends of the
fields and woods&mdash;to such returning
spring would be incomplete without their
coming. The earliest break in winter&rsquo;s
shackles tensions their ears to listen for
the first returning migrant&rsquo;s note. Of
these the last to leave and first to brave
the still vigorous, retreating winter gales
is Sir Crow. Painted by popular disfavor
even blacker than he merits, his departing
caw, mingled with the wild
goose&rsquo;s &ldquo;haunks,&rdquo; as they winged southward,
barely escaping the first cold wave.
His caw has mellowed with his sunny vacation.
In place of the discordant medley
echoing from the final grove convention
will come his spring notes, cawing
a domestic cadence half musical, suggesting
a chuckle of delight. By twos and
threes these black-coated scouts struggle
back to former frequentings. In early
February, perhaps, when the ambitious
sugar-maker is trying for his first &ldquo;run,&rdquo;
he there catches his first glimpse of blue-black
sheen as the northward flyer toilsomely
sweeps through the naked trees.
At this inhospitable season all of his proverbial
cunning stands him in good stead,
and truly he is a veritable solon of bird
wisdom. Nature seemingly compensated
for his gloomy dress and awkward flight
by bestowing almost incredible sagacity
behind his unattractive exterior.</p>
<p>We need not yet listen for other
sweeter-voiced arrivals, but while waiting
may give ear to some stay-at-home
all-winter residents, the chickadee and his
crested relative, the tufted titmouse,
cheery chirpers and whistlers both, unconquered
by the fiercest boreal blasts;
the quiet-voiced and colored junco, the
industrious creeper and nuthatch, not
forgetting that hide-and-go-seek climber
the downy woodpecker and his warmer
colored, hairy relative. The woodpeckers,
with their cheerful taps, trills and chatter,
have done much to dispel the gloom of
drear and frosty winter days.</p>
<p>But one is forgotten who in nature
absolutely refuses to remain unnoticed&mdash;Sir
Blue Jay&mdash;though an acknowledged
cannibal and highwayman, he is withal so
jaunty and attractive in everything but
his voice and his habits as to convince his
beholders that he is not half bad. With
February&rsquo;s closing days we may listen for
the hardier representatives of the sparrow
family, those twin aristocrats, the
white-crowned and white-throated beauties,
the more timid and ruddier fox, and
the well-known song sparrow. Being unobtrusive
in both song and garb, their
first greeting may be missed, but the
trained ear will soon catch the cheerful
notes from hedge or brush pile, elicited
by a chasing gleam of sunshine. These
sweet-toned singers will prove a welcome
contrast to the tiresome, incessant, complaining
notes of their English cousins,
who have spent the winter at the granary
door or skirmishing in the garbage on
the city streets. The sparrows are the
beginner&rsquo;s despair in ornithology, but are
as interesting in habits, song and appearance
as they are numerous and confusing.
The observer who can readily distinguish
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
them at all, from the familiar
household &ldquo;chippy&rdquo; to the siskins, linnets
and longspurs who frequent our latitudes
only as erratic winter visitors, is
truly to be envied. With March comes
that steadfast commoner the robin and
his warmer breasted thrush cousin, the
bluebird. The former, with his matter-of-fact
twitter of greeting, soon supplements
it with a bar of his hearty if somewhat
unpolished song. But the less intrepid
bluebird will wait for a south
wind&rsquo;s caress ere his gurgle of delight
will float earward as airily as his hovering
flight.</p>
<p>Now come two black-coated cousins,
the purple grackle and shoulder-strapped
redwing of the blackbird family. Field
hunters like the robin, but unlike the
thrushes, when on the ground they are
staid walkers instead of hoppers. These
dusky beauties no sooner announce their
arrival with songless cackling notes than
they hurry away to inspect their last
year&rsquo;s nesting haunts, where scrambling
clamor ensues for the most desirable locations.
Like the crow they lose but
little time in awaiting fine weather before
preparing for housekeeping. Even before
April&rsquo;s soft showers commence falling,
their bristling stick nests are in readiness,
as are the crows&rsquo;, jays&rsquo; and hawks&rsquo;,
while the owls&rsquo; wide-eyed nestlings are
even then becoming fluffy balls of feathers
in their better sheltered hollow-tree
nests. But we must pass with but a
word of greeting to the arrivals, would
we keep pace with their increasing numbers.
Now listen to the purple finch as
he perches on highest twig, proclaiming
his arrival with no uncertain sound. A
very torrent of bubbling melody is he,
though his breakfast may still be snow-enshrouded
below. While he rests may
be heard the meadowlark&rsquo;s tremulous,
plaintive diminuendo, as he alights from
his halting, uncertain flight. Soon will
follow the ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s name-calling, tail-wagging
cry and the barn swallow&rsquo;s
mumbling, metallic squeaking. His cliff
or eaves-nesting cousin will a little later
add his rasping notes as he repairs his
plastered nest. In contrast to the swallow&rsquo;s
rhythmic chatter comes the oriole&rsquo;s
bugle call and flute-like whistle, which
at evening was silent, but morning finds
vocal. With increasing numbers, as the
Mayflowers appear, come the crow-chasing
kingbird and his twin-named fish-catcher.
The first, with happy tinkling
notes, the second with bill-chattering rattle.
Again, morning hears the bobolink&rsquo;s
ecstatic songburst of tumultuous melody.
Like ships he &ldquo;passes in the night&rdquo;
and heralds his coming as no other can.
Now the whippoorwill proclaims his apt
naming, as evening closes in, while his
nighthawk cousin booms an accompaniment
as he wheels through the air above.
The wood pigeon&rsquo;s lament comes throbbing
through the warm morning air, confirming
his right to his other and better
known &ldquo;mourning dove&rdquo; title. To drown
the pigeon&rsquo;s dirge-like plaint may now
be heard the rollicking song of the goldfinch,
his song and flight dipping in unison
as he goes his careless way. With
still another contrast comes the clucking
cuckoo&rsquo;s grumble as if in excuse for his
tardy arrival. Now listen, for the chorus
is complete! Though but few have been
named, they are best known and with the
unnamed larger half compose nature&rsquo;s
magnificent if sometimes inharmonious
symphony. Among those unnamed are to
be found many fully the equals of those
so imperfectly represented in the preceding
pen pictures. In fact, the wood
thrushes and warblers unmentioned are
as finished vocal performers as any of
those heard in the open. Also in beauty
and brilliancy of coloring some of the
shyer and more silent wood residents
eclipse their brethren of the fields. But
birds are not learned in a day. Later on
the student&rsquo;s eye and ear will begin to
recognize such flashy men of color as
Messrs. Tanager, Towhee, Redstart,
Waxwings, Redpoll and scores of others
making up the lengthy list of warblers,
thrushes, wrens, flycatchers and others
less well known, especially by voice,
which is often discordant in proportion
to attractiveness of plumage. These
fragmentary glimpses and sound pictures
of our flitting friends have been attempted
with the intention of introducing them
to the ear rather than to the eye. Too
much importance is often attached to the
appearance to the neglect of aural attractions.
Nothing can exceed the pleasure
afforded the enthusiast in ornithology
when able to readily distinguish his
feathered friends by songs, notes, trills,
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
and twitters making up their repertoires.
As their voices greet him when awakening,
no calendar is needed to trace the
advancing seasons. The new voices added
to the morning chorus and its diminishing
volume as summer departs gives audible
record to the ear familiar with bird-voice
harmony. Again, when abroad in
pursuit of duty or pleasure, a single note
is sufficient to introduce to his ear a new
or old-time friend. He well knows the
first glimpse will disclose a dull or bright-hued
coat, whose owner&rsquo;s eyes are even
then scanning him from some well concealed
cover. If the learner would fully
appreciate the charms of his bird acquaintances
he should study each individual
until known not only by appearance
while at rest, but in every light, shade,
attitude and movement, and he should
study his voice until it is recognizable
whether in full-throated song or modulated
call or whistle. An occasional hour
or vacation may accomplish much, and
that often at our very doors; but to know
these breezy, beautiful habitants aright
city walls must be left behind.</p>
<p>Museum specimens, except for reference,
must be shunned as inert, lifeless
and voiceless. The bird only known by
appearance is but half known. When
known and understood their observers become
their champions whose arms and
voices will ever be raised to prevent their
wanton destruction.</p>

<h2 id="c11">THE SPIRIT OF SPRING.</h2>
<p>It came to me this morning, in my
room, and filled my whole being with a
subtle feeling of delight and mysterious
glad expectancy. When I went downstairs
they told me that it was colder
than yesterday; that the thermometer
registered 14 degrees above zero. But
what care I for the thermometer? What
does it know about spring?</p>
<p>Spring is a spirit which takes possession
of the air, be it hot or cold, and
makes one&rsquo;s heart sing for joy.</p>
<p>The crows kept telling me the glad
news, &ldquo;Spring has come!&rdquo; all the time
I was dressing, and it was echoed in the
tufted tit&rsquo;s questioning note when he
flew round the house to his breakfast
on the window sill. When I started out
for my morning walk the very air seemed
filled with tiny voices proclaiming the
good tidings.</p>
<p>I had not gone far before I heard a
cardinal singing gloriously, his song
answering the one in my own heart; and
the theme was ever, &ldquo;Spring has come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the crowning surprise and joy of
all came when I had reached the brook
pasture. I stopped, listened and caught
my breath; could it be on the 27th of
February? Yes, a song sparrow! No
one who is unacquainted with the purity
and simple charm of this bird&rsquo;s song,
which breathes of all that is fair and
good, can understand or appreciate the
rapture I felt upon hearing it again
this morning. Going on a little farther
I heard another song sparrow; the two
were singing by turns, answering each
other in sweetest melody. One could
scarcely wait until the other had finished
his strain, so eager were they to pour
out the good news.</p>
<p>Oh, if you who are tired or dull indoors
will only go out these mornings and fill
your lungs with the pure air of heaven
and your hearts with the rapture of
spring, how many of your cares will
drop away! Nature&rsquo;s myriad voices will
talk to you if you will listen; the birds
will sing to you the sweetest music in the
world&mdash;God&rsquo;s love in melody.</p>
<p>This joy in the beauties of Nature may
be yours if you will; do not allow such
a precious gift to escape you. It is beyond
price, yet free to all. Each year
adds to the wonder and value of Nature&rsquo;s
treasures; they are ever new, ever
more and more welcome with each returning
season. Happy are they who
know and love them well.</p>

<h2 id="c12">FROM AN ORNITHOLOGIST&rsquo;S YEAR BOOK.
<br /><span class="small">FLUTE OF ARCADY.</span></h2>
<p>In Ohio are many wide, grassy fields,
covering the rounded hillslopes or filling
open valleys. One day in March the
world was white with snow, and I heard,
as if in a dream, the soft cooing of the
doves. Never before had I heard it except
on sunny afternoons in pine woods,
rich with warm, resinous odors. It is
hardly a sound&mdash;rather silence perceptible,
blending so perfectly with the sunshine,
the hushed and brooding stillness
of the air, the half-conscious sense of life,
that I would often hear it a long while
without knowing that I listened&mdash;the soft,
tremulous cooing of the wood-doves, yet
here the earth was white with snow and
the air chill.</p>
<p>But the doves were right. Spring was
near, and in a little while the feathery
grass was nodding in the warm wind,
gray and hazy, as the great white clouds
swept overhead with wing-like shadows,
or shining, each tiny blade like burnished
steel, in the sunlight. The cooing of the
doves had been only a low prelude; now
the air was ringing with melody.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;N&rsquo;er a leaf was dumb;</p>
<p class="t0">Around us all the thickets rung</p>
<p class="t">To many a flute of Arcady.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The fresh, glad songs of the western
meadow larks! Everywhere, everywhere,
the air was vibrant with the poignant
sweetness of their silvery voices;
everywhere you might see the shining
yellow of their breasts as they rose with
strong wing; everywhere you might perhaps
chance to stumble upon some nest
of woven grasses. Often with arched
covering, on the very ground, with the
dear little brownish mother bending over
four or six white eggs, freckled with
cinnamon spots. It is the season of the
larks, and earth and sky are more lovely
for the magic of their singing. One
hardly knows how to describe it in words.
Spring o&rsquo; the year! Spring o&rsquo; the year!
it seems to say to the listener, both in
the east and west, but the song of the
western meadow lark has a richer melody,
a more piercing delight. It seems
to talk of forgotten things; of youth and
first hopes; first love; it has all the glamour
of the far-away, and yet a sweetness
of the near. It rises from the thick grass
at your feet, yet it mounts towards the
blue sky! It is a veritable Flute of Arcady
blown with a breath of joy.</p>

<p class="t">They rise with a timorous cry.</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;Duncan Campbell Scott, &ldquo;Sandpipers.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Very early in the spring the Red-backed
Sandpiper leaves its winter home
in the States and countries bordering the
Gulf of Mexico and starts on its long
journey to the cooler region of the far
north. It arrives in Alaska early in May,
in full breeding plumage, and the males
are soon engaged in prettily wooing the
coy females. Mr. Nelson, who had unexcelled
opportunities for studying the
habits of these interesting sandpipers,
well describes their courting habits. He
says: &ldquo;The males may be seen upon
quivering wings flying after the female
and uttering a musical, trilling note,
which falls upon the ear like the mellow
tinkle of large water-drops falling rapidly
into a partly filled vessel. Imagine
the sounds thus produced by the water
run together into a steady and rapid trill
some five or ten seconds in length, and
the note of this Sandpiper is represented.
It is not loud, but has a rich, full tone,
difficult to describe, but pleasant to hear.
As the lover&rsquo;s suit approaches its end the
handsome suitor becomes exalted, and in
his moments of excitement he rises fifteen
or twenty yards, and hovering on
tremulous wings over the object of his
passion, pours forth a perfect gush of
music, until he glides back to earth exhausted,
but ready to repeat the effort
a few minutes later. The female coyly
retreats before the advance of the male,
but after various mishaps each bird finds
its partner for the summer and they start
off house-hunting in all the ardor of a
rising honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Red-backed Sandpiper is not a
bird architect and it does not build even
a simple home. A slight hollow on a
dry knoll, which commands a clear view
of some body of water, is the site usually
selected. Here the eggs are laid, either
upon the dry grass already in the hollow
or upon a few bits of leaves, twigs and
grass hastily gathered and placed without
order. After the appearance of the
eggs the male seems to realize the responsibility
of family cares, for his merry
song ceases and he devotes his share of
time to sitting on the nest, protecting
the eggs with his warm body. That this
is the case is shown by the bare patches
that appear on his breast at this season.</p>
<p>With such a home as is prepared for
their reception, it is not surprising that
the little red-backs leave the nest as soon
as they are hatched and freely run about.
When frightened they readily conceal
themselves by sitting on the ground and
remaining quiet.</p>
<p>This species exhibits considerable variation
in the color of its plumage. In the
spring and summer it may be known by
the black patch on the belly and reddish
color of its back, which is mottled with
white and black. At this season it is
often called Blackbreast. In the fall and
winter the upper parts are brownish-gray
in color and the under parts are
whitish. It is then frequently called the
Leadback. The Red-back is not as active
as the other sandpipers and its unsuspicious
nature makes it seem quite stupid.
Though a beach bird, it is not infrequently
met in grassy marshes, and by some
it is called the Grass-bird.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h2 id="c15">A PANSY OF HARTWELL.</h2>
<p>I was a Pansy of Hartwell, a dainty
little thing, with gold and purple petals,
touched with white, and leaves of tender
green&mdash;&ldquo;a dear, delicate thing, but
fair,&rdquo; so Louise said. I grew below her
chamber window, where she had prepared
a rich, warm bed of mother earth
for me and for hundreds of my kindred.
&ldquo;But none,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no, not one of
my kind, was ever so beautiful as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember my birthland well. Our
old home in Hartwell, where Louise
and I were born, was surrounded by a
wide, rolling lawn, filled with blooming
flowers from the time of the first
peep of the early March crocus to the
stately bloom and decay of the autumn
flowers. Here, too, near her window
grew a straight, tall maple tree, whose
branches stretched far and wide and
even touched her window.</p>
<p>I liked this tree because it gave us a
pleasant shade when the sun&rsquo;s rays were
inclined to be too warm and made us
droop and feel so languid and so tired.
Delicate, dainty things, as Louise and
I, must not have too much sunshine,
else we droop and die.</p>
<p>One day I asked Louise if this tree
was old. I knew it was by the many
deep furrows in its bark, but I loved
the music of her voice so much that I
often asked her useless questions that I
might lift up my head and listen to its
melody. Louise then told me its age
and much else that I had never heard.
She said that with each returning
springtime this tree sent up the life-giving
sap from its roots, which ran
swiftly through the trunk to the
branches. Soon on these branches little
red buds appeared, then a bloom and
finally leaves, and wonderful little wing-like
looking keys which held the seeds
of the maple tree.</p>
<p>These were strange, wonderful things
for me to hear, but I knew them to be
true, because Louise told them to me.
No one ever doubted Louise, for all her
life long she had worshiped at the altar
of truth, and, because of her truthfulness,
her beauty and her goodness, all
things loved her.</p>
<p>Besides giving us moisture and
shade, the south wind told me that this
same fine old tree held in its forks a
home for some little friends of Louise.
When the March winds left us and the
skies became clear and blue and warm,
her friends the robins would return to
their old home as they had done for
many seasons past, and there under her
kindly, watchful care would raise their
brood of young.</p>
<p>One day I saw her&mdash;I was always
watching her&mdash;drop a bit of cotton and
several strings down from her window.
The cotton fell near my bed. I wondered
and wondered why she had done
this thing. A long time afterward I
was told that it was for the use of
Mother Robin in making her nest.
Father Robin thanked my dear Louise
for her thoughtfulness by singing for
her his most beautiful notes at the dawn,
the noon-time and the evening.</p>
<p>I lived in happiness in that quaint old
town of Hartwell, caring naught for
its bright skies, wide rolling plains, its
peaceful waters, its fruits of tree and
vine. I was young; I was happy; I
lived near Louise; it was all that I
desired.</p>
<p>I remember&mdash;but why should I tell
you? I am only a little pansy, born,
perhaps, for an hour or a day, to bloom
and be gathered and die&mdash;so the south
wind has told me. It must know. &ldquo;God
gave the flowers and birds and all things
for man&rsquo;s use and abuse,&rdquo; so you say;
but I had thought it different, for I lived
in the sunshine of Louise&rsquo;s love and tender
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
care. One day&mdash;how well I remember
it!&mdash;it was a day in sunny, coquettish
April&mdash;when I heard voices approaching.
Nearer and nearer they
came, until I felt the presence of my dear
Louise with her dark haired friend. I
could not see them, for one of my sister
pansies held her head so high and
haughty that a little pansy such as I
could not see or be seen.</p>
<p>This day Louise was more tender
than usual. Alas! why is it ever true
that dearest love is bought at the price
of death and separation?</p>
<p>She bent down, half hesitatingly, and
kissed me, touched my petals lovingly,
and whispered so gently&mdash;only I could
hear: &ldquo;My beauty, my golden-hearted
pansy, shall I&mdash;must I&mdash;give you to my
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind gave back my answer. I
was sacrificed on the altar of friendship.</p>
<p>Then I felt my heartstrings slowly
tugged at, and quivering and wounded
and bleeding I was taken from my home,
the home Louise had made for me, and
placed in a basket with my cousins, the
violets, to be carried to a new home,
to meet new faces and perhaps make
new friends.</p>
<p>Louise and this friend loved each
other very dearly. Alas! for me, they
loved pansies, too.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was an honor for Louise to
have chosen me from among a hundred
others, for to her a pansy was the dearest,
the daintiest and most coquettish of all
the flowers that bloom and die. But,
though I felt the honor, I would a thousand
times rather have lived to lift my
petals to the breezes in my native land
without glory and without pain; or better
still, death on Louise&rsquo;s breast, with her
smiles and caresses, was preferable to
honor and glory in a stranger&rsquo;s land. I
say this was preferable, but how foolish I
am; we pansies have no preference. We
of the flower family must take what you
of the human family choose to give us.</p>
<p>This friend of Louise&rsquo;s, I knew not her
name and cared not to know, carried me
very gently with the violets, protecting
me from the sun and dust as we went;
and when I awoke from my misery and
my long, long journey, I found myself
an exile, with my kindred, in the far
south-land where the birds are always
singing, and the flowers are ever blooming,
and youth and beauty and old age
go hand in hand.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful home to which I
was brought. Here I was surrounded
with all that a pansy&rsquo;s heart should long
for; but I was not happy. I was not
content. Soon my face looked sad; my
shining green leaves began to wither and
droop, and the breath of the south wind
became so hot I felt as though I could
not live. Then the battle against death
began. I longed to live that I might see
Louise once more. Then I tried to live
for her to whom she had sacrificed me.
I made a brave struggle for life, but all
in vain. It was the battle of the weak
against the strong.</p>
<p>Since life has left me and I have become
a spirit flower with my earthly
body caged between the pages of a
musty old book, which my spirit may
enter at will, Louise&rsquo;s friend often holds
communion with me. It is then I ask,
&ldquo;Does she love me, or is it Louise, of
whom she thinks, for whom she longs
when she looks at me so lovingly and
talks to me of the old days?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c16">GARNET.</h2>
<p>This stone exhibits many varieties of
color and of composition. The color
probably most often thought of in connection
with it is dark red, but it would
be a mistake to suppose this the only
color which it may manifest. Green, red,
rose and brown are other colors which
garnet transparent enough to be used as
gems exhibits, while among opaque garnets
may be found black and many varieties
of the shades above mentioned.</p>
<p>These variations of color are more or
less connected with differences of composition
which it may be well first of all
to consider. Garnet as a mineral is, like
most minerals used as precious stones, a
silicate. United with the silica the element
most commonly occurring is aluminum.
If calcium be united with
these two the variety of garnet
known as grossularite, or essonite, or
cinnamon stone, is produced. If magnesium
takes the place of calcium,
then pyrope is formed. If iron, we have
almandite, and if manganese, spessartite.
Another variety of garnet, andradite,
is composed of calcium and iron in
combination with silica, and still another,
uvarovite, of calcium, chromium
and silica. Though they seem to differ so
much in composition, all kinds of garnet
crystallize in the same system and are
closely allied in all their properties, so
that it is always an easy matter to distinguish
garnet of any variety from other
minerals.</p>
<p>Garnet crystals may be of the twelve-sided
form, known as dodecahedrons, the
faces of which have the shape of rhombs,
or the twenty-four-sided form known as
trapezohedrons, the faces of which have
the shape of trapeziums. Quite as commonly
occur crystals which are combinations
of these two forms, and then exhibit
thirty-six faces, as in the crystal
from Alaska shown in the accompanying
illustration. Sometimes the crystals attain
considerable size, some perfect ones
from Colorado weighing fifteen pounds,
while crystals two feet in diameter are reported
from North Carolina. A curious
feature of garnet crystals is that of often
inclosing other minerals. The garnets
from New Mexico, for instance, when
broken open are sometimes found to contain
a small grain of quartz. In the crystals
from East Woodstock, Maine, only
the outside shell is garnet and the interior
is calcite. Other crystals are made up of
layers of garnet and some other mineral.</p>
<p>Garnet has a strong tendency to crystallize,
and hence is usually found as
crystals. The grains of garnet found in
the sands of river beds and on beaches,
though not often showing crystal form,
may be really fragments of crystals. Garnet
is one of the most common constituents
of such sands because of its hardness
and power of resisting decay. These
properties enable it to endure after the
other ingredients of the rocks of which
it formed a part have been worn away.
It is quite heavy as compared with the
quartz of which the sand is mostly composed,
and hence continually accumulates
on a beach, while the quartz is in part
blown away. In such localities it will always
be found near the water line, because
the waves, on account of its weight,
can carry it but a slight distance inland.
Practically all garnet is three and one-half
times as heavy as water, and some
four times as heavy. Garnet, as a rule,
is somewhat harder than quartz, its hardness
being 7&frac12; in the scale of which
quartz is 7. Some varieties are, however,
somewhat softer. The hardness of garnet
and its uneven fracture are properties
which give it an extensive use for rubbing
and polishing wood. For this purpose
it is spread upon glued paper in the
manner of sandpaper and is used similarly,
but it is superior to the latter. Most
varieties of garnet fuse quite readily before
the blowpipe, and the globules thus
formed will be magnetic if the garnet
contains much iron. The green garnet,
uvarovite, is almost infusible, however.
Garnet is not much affected by ordinary
acids, although it may be somewhat decomposed
by long heating.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>The name garnet is said by some authorities
to come from the Latin word
granatus, meaning like a grain, and to
have arisen in allusion to the resemblance
of its crystals in color and size to the
seeds of the pomegranate. The German
word for garnet, granat, is the same
as the Latin word. Others think the word
derived from the Latin name of the
cochineal insect in allusion to a similarity
in color.</p>
<p>The use of garnet for gem purposes
seems to date back to the earliest times.
Among the ornaments adorning the oldest
Egyptian mummies there are frequently
found necklaces containing garnet.
The Romans prized the stone highly,
and it is a gem very largely used at
the present day, its hardness and durability
and richness and permanency of
color giving it all the qualities desired
in a precious stone.</p>
<p>Two varieties of garnet, almandite and
pyrope, may exhibit the dark blood-red
color especially ascribed to garnet. Almandite
or almandine garnet derives its
name from Alabanda, a city of Asia
Minor, in the ancient district of Caria,
whence garnet was first brought to
the Romans. The finest almandite for
a long time came from near the city of
Sirian, in the old province of Pegu,
Lower Burmah. While this was the center
of supply, it is not known just where
the garnets were obtained. Such garnets
are still known as &ldquo;Sirian&rdquo; garnets.
Their color tends toward the violet of the
ruby and gives them a high value. There
are several localities in Northern India
where almandite is mined on a large
scale, and the stone is much used in Indian
jewelry. Some of these localities
are Condapilly, Sarwar and Cacoria.
Almandite is also found in Brazil, in Australia,
in several localities in the Alps,
and in the United States. Stones
from all these regions are found suitable
for cutting, the only qualifications needed
being sufficient size and transparency
and good color. The almandite of Alaska
shown in the accompanying plate occurs
in great quantities near the mouth
of the Stickeen river, but has not been
extensively cut on account of its being too
opaque. Almandite usually occurs in
metamorphic rocks, such as gneisses or
mica schists; also in granite. It is also
found in many gem gravels. From the
ruby it can be distinguished, as can all
varieties of garnet, by its lower hardness
and single refraction of light. In artificial
light, too, it borrows a yellow tint,
rendering it less pleasing, while the color
of ruby grows more intense.</p>
<p>Pyrope, the magnesian variety of garnet,
does not differ much in color from
almandite. Both are dark red, but while
almandite tends toward a violet tone,
pyrope shades toward yellow. Pyrope is
lighter than almandite, the specific gravity
being 3.7 to 3.8, while that of almandite
is 4.1 to 4.3. It is also less easily
fusible. It rarely occurs in crystals, and
where found in place is always associated
with the magnesium-bearing rocks, peridotite
or serpentine.</p>
<p>It is thus probably always of eruptive
origin. Pyrope is a characteristic constituent
of the diamond-bearing rock of
South Africa, and is the stone known in
trade as &ldquo;Cape ruby.&rdquo; These garnets afford
many excellent gems. The home of
the pyrope, however, is and has been for
many centuries, Bohemia. Here it is
found in many localities, but chiefly in
the northwestern part, near Teplitz and
Berlin. The garnets are found in a
gravel or conglomerate of Cretaceous age,
resulting from the decomposition of a
serpentine. Sometimes, however, they
are found in the matrix and often associated
with a brown opal. They are found
by digging and separated by washing.
Though of good quality the scones are
small, those as large as a hazel
nut being found but rarely. Although
the Bohemian garnets have
been known for many centuries,
the industry of mining and cutting
them on a large scale is said not to
have assumed any special proportions until
the advent of foreigners to Karlsbad.
In this way a knowledge of the stones
went out to other countries, and a demand
sprang up which has led to the establishment
of a great industry and made
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
Bohemia the garnet center of the world.
There are over three thousand men employed
at the present time simply in cutting
the stones, and if to these be added
the number of miners and gold and silver
smiths occupied in the mining and
mounting of the garnets, it is estimated
that a total of 10,000 persons are engaged
in the Bohemian garnet industry.
The stones are used not alone for jewelry
and for ornamenting gold and silver
plate, but also extensively for watch jewels
and for polishing. Excellent pyropes
are found in Arizona, New Mexico and
Southern Colorado in our own country.
They occur in the beds of streams as
rolled pebbles, and often associated with
the green chrysolite or peridot of the
eruptive rock from which they came.
They are especially abundant about anthills,
being removed by the ants because
their size stands in the way of the excavations
of the busy insects. The name
pyrope comes from the Greek word for
fire, and is applied on account of the color
of the stone.</p>
<p>Of quite similar origin is the name carbuncle,
a term applied to nearly all fiery
red stones in Roman times, but now used
to designate garnets cut in the oval form
known as cabochon. The word carbuncle
comes from the Latin word carbo, coal,
and refers to the internal fire-like color
and reflection of garnets.</p>
<p>The calcium-aluminum variety of garnet,
grossularite, cinnamon stone or essonite,
is less used in jewelry than those
above mentioned. It is usually yellow
to brown in color, but may be rose red
or pink, as in the specimen from Mexico
shown in the accompanying plate. The
yellow grossularites resemble in color the
gem known as hyacinth and are sometimes
sold in place of the latter, but true
hyacinth is much heavier and doubly refracting.
About the only essonites or
cinnamon stones available for gems come
from Ceylon. These are of good size and
color. Those from Italy, shown in the
accompanying plate, are too small to cut
into gems, but surrounded as they are
by light green chlorite and pyroxene, they
make very pretty mineral specimens.
Grossularite is almost always found in
crystalline limestone.</p>
<p>Green garnets are of two kinds, the
calcium-iron garnet, known as demantoid,
and the calcium-chromium garnet
known as uvarovite. The demantoid
garnets come only from the Urals. They
have a rich green color and make beautiful
gems when good ones can be found.
The name demantoid refers to the diamond-like
luster which they possess. The
stone is also known as &ldquo;Uralian emerald.&rdquo;
Uvarovite, named for Count Uvarov of
Russia, also makes valuable gems if found
in pieces of sufficient size and luster. It
is found in Russia, in Pennsylvania and
in Canada. Garnet has long been the
birthstone of the month of January.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;By her who in this month is born</p>
<p class="t0">No gems save garnets should be worn.</p>
<p class="t0">They will insure her constancy,</p>
<p class="t0">True friendship and fidelity.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Such are the virtues ascribed to the
garnet. That the stone has been known
and used from the earliest times I have
already remarked. Under the name of
carbuncle mention is made of it in the literature
of all ages, its impressive feature
being usually the brilliant, fiery light
which it gives forth. According to the
Talmud, the only light which Noah had
in the ark was afforded by a carbuncle,
and there are many Oriental tales regarding
the size and brilliancy of carbuncles
owned by the potentates of the East. Occasionally
carbuncles were engraved, and
some fine garnet intaglios are still known.
The greater abundance of the stone in
modern times has led to its being less
highly prized than formerly, and to its
being put to other uses than mere adornment,
but it perhaps contributes more
largely to the comfort and happiness of
the world as it is now used than could
ever have been the case when it was the
property only of kings.</p>

<h2 id="c17">ANIMAL EMOTIONS.</h2>
<p>Through the emotions we are apt to
judge ourselves somewhat superior
to the animal creation, though perhaps
a more thorough study and interest
in the &ldquo;smiles and tears&rdquo; of the
so-called creatures of lesser intelligence
would teach us that the emotions play
almost as important and distinctive a
part in their organism as in our own
oversensitive nerve force. I am not
speaking of the emotion of fear and
anger that is instinctive in all animals,
but of the more subtle emotions of joy
and grief as visibly expressed. The older
epic writers made much of the grief expressed
by horses, and their sorrows
have formed many an heroic verse. Merrick,
in his &ldquo;Tryphiodorus,&rdquo; says:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He stands, and careless of his golden grain,</p>
<p class="t0">Weeps his associates and his master slain.</p>
</div>
<p>Says Moschus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nothing is heard upon the mountains now</p>
<p class="t0">But pensive herds that for their master low,</p>
<p class="t0">Struggling and comfortless about they rove,</p>
<p class="t0">Unmindful of their pasture and their love.</p>
</div>
<p>Virgil, who was probably more conversant
with the horse and his interests
than almost any other writer of that faraway
period, thus writes of the sorrow
of Pallas&rsquo; steed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state,</p>
<p class="t0">Is led, the funeral of his lord to wait;</p>
<p class="t0">Stripp&rsquo;d of his trappings, with a sullen pace</p>
<p class="t0">He walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Iliad, Homer thus renders the
emotion of Patroclus&rsquo; war horses evinced
for that hero:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:</p>
<p class="t0">Still as a tombstone, never to be moved</p>
<p class="t0">On some good man or woman unreproved</p>
<p class="t0">Lays its eternal weight; or fix&rsquo;d, as stands</p>
<p class="t0">A marble courser by the sculptor&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p class="t0">Placed on the hero&rsquo;s grave. Along their face</p>
<p class="t0">The big round drops coursed down with silent pace,</p>
<p class="t0">Conglobing with the dust. Their manes, that late</p>
<p class="t0">Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,</p>
<p class="t0">Trail&rsquo;d on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,</p>
<p class="t0">And prone to earth was hung their languid head.</p>
</div>
<p>Shakespeare, in &ldquo;As You Like It,&rdquo;
tells of the tears shed by a wounded stag:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The wretched animal heav&rsquo;d forth such groans,</p>
<p class="t0">That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</p>
<p class="t0">Almost to bursting; and the big round tears</p>
<p class="t0">Cours&rsquo;d one another down his innocent nose</p>
<p class="t0">In piteous chase.</p>
</div>
<p>All, or nearly all, animals are sensitive
to music, which affects them in various
ways, and again it is Shakespeare who
refers to this sensitiveness in even untrained
horses, proving its effect to be instinctive:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For do but note a wild and wanton herd</p>
<p class="t0">Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,</p>
<p class="t0">Fetching mad? bounds, bellowing, and neighing loud,</p>
<p class="t0">Which is the hot condition of their blood</p>
<p class="t0">If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,</p>
<p class="t0">Or any air of music touch their ears,</p>
<p class="t0">You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</p>
<p class="t0">Their savage eye turned to a modest gaze</p>
<p class="t0">By the sweet power of music.</p>
</div>
<p>There is an ancient account of the
Libyan mares to whom it was necessary
to discourse sweet music in order to
tame them sufficiently to be milked, and
the horses of the Sybarites, who have
been taught to dance to certain strains
of music, inopportunely heard the same
strains of music on their way to battle
and very much chagrined their masters
by stopping to dance instead of going
forward to fight, such was the influence
of the familiar tune. De Vere gives an
account of a certain Lord Holland who
was very eccentric, and used during the
time of William III to give his horses
weekly concerts in a covered gallery specially
erected for the purpose. He maintained
that it cheered their hearts and
improved their temper, and an eye witness
says that they seemed to be greatly
delighted with the performance. Not at
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
all a bad suggestion for owners of those
horses who do not &ldquo;come up to time&rdquo;
at the present day. A few years ago, according
to the &ldquo;American Naturalist,&rdquo; experiments
were made in Lincoln Park,
Chicago, to determine with scientific accuracy
the effect of violin playing on
different animals. It says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music which was slow and sweet,
like &lsquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Annie
Laurie,&rsquo; pleased the panthers, a jaguar
and a lioness and her cubs. The panthers
became nervous and twitched their
tails when a lively jig, &lsquo;The Irish Washerwoman,&rsquo;
was played to them, and relapsed
into their former quiet when the
music again became soothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jaguar was so nervous during
the jig music that he jumped from a
shelf to the floor of his cage and back
again. When the player ceased playing
and walked away the jaguar reached out
his paw to him as far as he could. His
claws were drawn back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lioness and her cubs were interested
from the first, though when the
violinist approached the cage the mother
gave him a hiss and the cubs hid behind
her. At the playing of a lively jig the
cubs stood up on their hind legs and
peeped over at the player. When the
musician retreated from the cage the
animals came to the front of it and did
not move back when he gradually drew
so near as almost to touch the great
paws that were thrust through the bars.
When playing &lsquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rsquo; the
entire family seemed very attentive, and
were motionless except that the cubs
turned their heads from side to side.
Then another jig was played and the
cubs danced about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coyotes, in a den, squatted in a
semi-circle and sat silently while the
music continued. When it ceased they
ran up and pawed at the player through
the bars. He began afresh, and they
again formed in a silent semi-circle.
This experiment was tried several times
with the same results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of us are familiar with the story
of the man who was chased by wolves
and who climbed to the rafters of an old
cabin out of reach of the vicious fangs,
but who fortunately carried with him
an old violin, and through its means he
was able to hold the wolves in thrall the
night through by his music until the
last string of the violin snapped and
the brutes prepared to make an onslaught,
but at that moment the first
gleams of the coming day appeared and
the wolves forsook their prey and disappeared.</p>
<p>Much has been written of the effect of
music upon elephants and their tempers.
Gentle strains have moved them to caresses,
and martial music arouses them
to a sort of fury. It has been written
that the Arab, than whom there is no
truer lover of the animal creation, entertains
his camel with music, songs and
fairy tales. When the animal lags in its
long swinging trot, the Bedouin draws
his reed-pipe from the folds of his turban
and sharp and shrill its notes are heard
far across the dusky sands, and the
weary camel, encouraged by its notes,
moves on again with enlivened motion.</p>
<p>It has often been noticed how quickly
a cow will distinguish a new bell, and
how great a disturbance is created in
the whole herd, who will often take it
upon themselves to chastise the unwary
wearer. De Vere is an authority for the
fact that the leader of a herd of cows
when deprived of her beloved bell will
weep bitter tears, and says that there
are many instances of cows that have
died when deprived of their harmonious
ornament.</p>
<p>That mice have a musical ear and taste
is a well known fact, but the lowest type
of animal that is visibly affected by a
strain of music is the turtle. Readers
of that sensational tale, &ldquo;The Household
of Bouverie,&rdquo; will remember the history
of the small tortoise &ldquo;Merodach&rdquo; whom
his master could summon at will by playing
a certain air on an old lyre, a tale
that was said to be founded on fact.</p>

<h2 id="c18">DOMESTIC CATTLE.</h2>
<p>In the beautiful Swiss Alps, in the
early springtime, one hears the ringing
of a large bell. This is rung in the villages
and is the signal for the departure
of the herds to the alps above. The
cows, lowing and jumping with delight,
collect eager for departure. The finest
cow of all has the largest bell hung from
her neck with a bright ribbon, and between
her horns is placed a large nosegay
of flowers.</p>
<p>She is the leader and has the place of
honor, and to deprive her of this pleasure
would be cruelty indeed. The herdsmen
begin their songs, the yodling sounds
through the valley, the milk stools are
set between the horns of the cattle, the
cheese kettles and provisions are packed
upon the beasts of burden, and the procession
gaily wends its way up the mountainside.</p>
<p>Even if poorly protected from storms
which may be encountered above, we cannot
wonder that the cattle thoroughly enjoy
this calm, beautiful life in the alps,
and we are told that cows left in the valley
below will often escape and follow
their companions to the distant mountains.</p>
<p>In the United States there are also cattle
that live an outdoor life, which have
the freedom of the range, and are shelterless
the year around. These are the half-wild
herds which roam over Texas, Colorado
and other western states. Although
the great cattle owners often inclose immense
pastures, thousands of acres in extent,
so that the herds are in a measure
restricted, the smaller owners turn their
cattle out and allow them to wander at
will.</p>
<p>This occasions the necessity for the
yearly &ldquo;round-up.&rdquo; At a given time the
cattle of each county are driven to a common
center, confined within an inclosure
or &ldquo;corral,&rdquo; and the calves running with
the cow mother are branded with the
mark of the owners. The &ldquo;round-up&rdquo; is
the great event of the cowboy&rsquo;s life, and
an interesting occasion it certainly is.
The time of the &ldquo;round-up&rdquo; may consume
a number of days. The cowboys take
their places on the outer limit of the tract
belonging to their division, and with
a skill acquired by long experience they
are able to find every cow and calf and
slowly to draw the circle smaller and
smaller, until all the cattle are congregated
in one herd. Then follows a time
of work by day and merrymaking by
night. The camp is maintained until all
the cattle are branded with the brands
which are registered with the county
clerk, thus making the ownership plain to
all. The cowboys, with their broad hats
frequently ornamented with the various
brands of the cattle owners, with their
picturesque attire, mounted on their
bronchos, or scraggy, wiry mountain ponies,
are interesting individually and collectively.
Among them at the time of the
&ldquo;round-up&rdquo; are often men of education
and refinement, as well as others who
know no life besides that of the plains
and the open. They ride like the wind,
and when one rode to his ranch neighbor&rsquo;s
thirteen miles away to execute a little
commission before breakfast and returned
before the coffee was spoiled, my eastern
ideas received a shock which made it necessary
for me to readjust my conception
of western life and living.</p>
<p>Mr. Brehm tells us that the manner of
life of the domestic cattle of various
countries is instructive as well as fascinating.
He tells us that there are &ldquo;herds
which lead the same manner of existence
as did those belonging to the patriarchs.
The wandering tribes of Eastern Soudan
are herdsmen, who attend to their duties
in exactly the same way as their ancestors
did thousands of years ago. Herds of
cattle constitute their only riches. Their
wealth is estimated by the number of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
sheep and cattle, as that of the Laplander
is estimated by the number of his reindeer.</p>
<p>The greatest of European landowners
and cattle breeders, including those of
Holland and Switzerland, can hardly realize
the vast numbers contained in the
herds of those nomads. Near the village
of Melbess the plain shows a deep depression,
at the bottom of which a number
of wells have been dug, one beside
the other, for the sole purpose of watering
the herds congregating there during
the noon hours. Beginning in the afternoon
and during the whole night, far on
toward noon next day, nearly a hundred
people are busy hauling water from the
wells and pouring it into pools, to which
a little salty earth is added. From all
sides innumerable herds of sheep, goats
and cattle draw near, first the sheep and
goats, then the cows. In a few minutes
the valley is filled with them. One sees
nothing but an unbroken herd of animals
passing back and forth, a dark human
form looming up between them at intervals.
Thousands of sheep and goats keep
arriving, while as many are departing satisfied.
I believe it impossible to count
the number of cattle, yet I do not exaggerate
if I put down the number of the
animals daily congregating at the spot as
sixty thousand.</p>
<p>In the south of Africa the oxen are of
great importance, as without them the
extended trip necessary for purposes of
trading and hunting through the vast
wastes in parts entirely devoid of water
and grass would be impossible.</p>
<p>In Southern Russia, Tartary and probably
also a great portion of Central Asia
considerable herds of cattle are kept.&rdquo; In
fact, at the present time there seems to
be no country in the world where domestic
cattle are not found. They are common
from Norway and Lapland in the
north to Southern Africa and South
America in the south. Columbus first
brought them to the New World, and
the Spaniards transported them to South
America, where they multiplied with
great rapidity.</p>
<p>In a general way domestic cattle may
be divided into two classes&mdash;the straight
backed cattle of Europe and the New
World and the humped cattle of India.
Humped cattle may also be found in
China, Africa and Madagascar. They
not only vary from other cattle by having
the hump on the withers, but they
have a different coloration, voice and habits.
They have a convex forehead, long,
drooping ears and a dew-lap, which
hangs in folds the entire length of the
neck. They vary much in size, as the
largest &ldquo;may stand as high as a buffalo,
while the smallest may be little larger
than a calf a month old.&rdquo; They are gentle
in disposition and the larger ones are
used for drawing native carriages. Unlike
the European cattle, they seldom
seek the shade, and never stand knee-deep
in water. These cattle are often
called zebus, and in the northern provinces
of India, where they are used for
riding, they will carry &ldquo;a man at the rate
of six miles an hour for fifteen hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White bulls are held peculiarly sacred
by the Hindus, and when they have been
dedicated to Siva by the branding of his
image upon them, they are thenceforth
relieved from all labor. They go without
molestation wherever they choose, and
may be seen about eastern bazars helping
themselves to whatever dainties they prefer
from the stalls of the faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Central Africa the humped cattle
are represented by the Galla, or Sanga.
This is regarded by some as the finest
breed of the humped variety. It is large,
slender and vigorous, long legged and
rather long tailed. The general color is
a chestnut-brown. The horns are very
strong and are fully forty inches in
length.</p>
<p>The straight backed cattle are those of
Europe, America, Australia and the
smaller islands, and of some parts of
Africa. They may be long-horned, short-horned
or hornless. Among them are
very many breeds, many well known being
common almost everywhere.</p>
<p>One is the ox of Freiburg, or the Swiss
ox. This variety yields both excellent
beef and extremely rich milk.</p>
<p>The Dutch ox is marked by stately
proportions, uniform coloring, a long,
tapering head and a long and thin neck.
The color is pied, a white or grayish
ground showing red, brown or black
spots of varying size and shape. &ldquo;It has
been bred in Holland for centuries. It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
easily fattened and has an abundant yield
of milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Durham or short-horned breed of
England is an animal with little symmetry
of proportion, with a small head, a
straight back and short legs. It is not a
good milker, but surpasses all in the production
of beef.</p>
<p>The beautiful Jersey cow is a great favorite
in America and Great Britain on
account of the rich cream and butter obtained
from the milk. The Alderneys
and Guernseys are classed with the Jerseys
and are also of &ldquo;elegant appearance.&rdquo;
Other breeds are the hornless Galloways,
the Devons, the Herefords, the Holsteins
and many others.</p>
<p>Like the sheep, the cat and other domestic
animals, the origin of domestic cattle
seems surrounded with mystery and
uncertainty. We know that in earliest
times domestic cattle were common, as
the earliest writings mention them and
the ancient monuments picture them. It
is, however, probable that all the straight
backed varieties, directly or indirectly,
may be traced back to the aurochs, or
urus, a most interesting wild ox of Europe.
This is extinct now, as well as
some other species which may form the
connecting link.</p>
<p>The aurochs was an animal of great
size, nearly as large as an elephant, but
with the form and color of a bull. Skulls
and bones, both in England and on the
Continent, show their characteristics, and
skulls pierced by flint hatchets show that
they were hunted by prehistoric hunters.
We do not know when they finally disappeared,
but in Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s time they
seem to have been common in the Black
Forest of Germany. Old chronicles prove
that they were found in the middle of
the sixth century, and in the ninth century
Charlemagne hunted the aurochs in
the forests near Aix-la-Chapelle. The
Nibelungen-Lied mentions the slaughter
of four in the twelfth century. In classic
literature there are accounts of contests
with gigantic wild oxen, indicating that
the animal&rsquo;s range extended as far south
as Greece. Bones have been found in a
number of European countries, and it is
certain that it roamed over Russia, but
how far to the eastward and northward
it wandered we cannot tell.</p>
<p>There still exist in England wild cattle
known as the &ldquo;park oxen.&rdquo; Though much
smaller in size, they seem to be more
like a direct descendant of the aurochs
than any other species, although probably
they descended from domesticated early
breeds. These herds are confined in private
parks, and the best known at the
present time is the Chillingham herd.
This park was probably inclosed about
the thirteenth century. The cattle are
small, with moderately rough, curly hair.
The insides of the ears and muzzles are
red, while the animals are white. They
have the characteristics of animals in a
wild state. &ldquo;They hide their young, feed
in the night, basking or sleeping during
the day. They are fierce when pressed,
but generally speaking are very timorous,
moving off on the appearance of anyone,
even at a great distance.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The Arrow Head is one of our most
familiar plants, quite as well known because
of its beautiful arrow-shaped leaves
as for its showy white flowers. It is interesting
and conspicuous among the
rushes and sedges that abound in the
sluggish waters that border lakes and
streams. It must have sunshine and well
illustrates the words of Thoreau: &ldquo;Rivers
and lakes are the great protectors of
plants against the aggressions of the forest,
by their annual rise and fall, keeping
open a narrow strip where these more
delicate plants have light and space in
which to grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are about twenty-five species of
the genus Sagittaria, to which the plant
of our illustration belongs. These inhabit
both temperate and tropical regions.
The generic name is from the Latin word
sagitta, meaning an arrow, and referring,
as does the common name, to the shape
of the leaf. When the Arrow Head
grows in water leaves are produced under
water that do not have the arrow shape.
These are not produced on those plants
that grow on wet, muddy banks.</p>
<p>Two kinds of flowers are produced by
this plant&mdash;the male and the female. The
male flowers are the large white ones
with a golden center formed by the group
of yellow stamens. The female flowers
are lower on the flower stalk and are dull
green and unattractive. This arrangement
of the flowers is nature&rsquo;s provision
for preventing self-fertilization. The insects
that visit these flowers naturally
first alight on the more brilliant staminate
flowers, and the pollen, adhering to
their bodies, is later transferred to the
seed producing flowers when the insects
visit them. Though the two flowers
are usually upon the same plant, they are
sometimes developed on distinct plants.
The Arrow Head beautifies the swampy
regions of North America from Mexico
northward.</p>
<h2 id="c21">THE BLACK COHOSH.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Cimicifuga racemosa.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Black Cohosh, or Black Snakeroot,
grows in rich woods from Canada
nearly to the Gulf of Mexico. It is a
conspicuous plant, with its long stem,
which sometimes grows to a height of
eight feet, and its large compound leaves,
as well as with its long raceme of numerous
small white flowers. This raceme
during the ripening of the fruit often acquires
a length of two to three feet.</p>
<p>This plant is sometimes called Bugbane.
The name Cimicifuga is from the
Latin words cimex, a bug, and fugo, to
drive away. Both the technical name and
the name Bugbane allude to the offensive
odor of the flowers, which was supposed
to drive away insects. In fact, the Black
Cohosh is held in high repute by some
Indians as a cure for the bite of poisonous
snakes, as well as a powerful aid in
driving away insects. Were it not for
the strong, disagreeable odor of the flowers,
which are only frequented by those
flies which enjoy the odor of carrion, with
its &ldquo;tall white rockets shooting upward
from a mass of large, handsome leaves,&rdquo;
it would be a striking ornament for the
flower garden.</p>

<h2 id="c23">THE SPRING MIGRATION.
<br /><span class="small">II. IN CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI.</span></h2>
<p>In the former article under this title
attention was paid to the warblers only.
In the present one I will try to give you
some idea of the other birds that in spring
take part in this general movement northward.
A few birds that cannot properly
be classed among the winter residents
visit us now and then on warm summery
days in January and February; they may
be called the advance guard of the great
army of migration. Conspicuous among
these are the bluebird and the hermit
thrush, two birds closely related, but
very different both in coloring and disposition.</p>
<p>The bluebird is one of the first birds
to be learned by the country children; his
bright colors, cheerful music and affectionate,
trusting disposition make him a
general favorite. Right here permit me
to digress enough to say that too little
encouragement is given the children of
our public schools, especially in the country,
to learn the names and habits of
our common birds. A little time and
effort judiciously expended by the
teacher in guiding the pupils to an understanding
and love of the bird life
about them would be an investment paying
large dividends in quickened perceptions
and increased interest in the too
often dull and distasteful round of
school work.</p>
<p>The hermit thrush is a lover of the
deep, dark shades where he can sit on
a twig and watch the stirring life about
him without being a part of it&mdash;a kind
of chimney corner philosopher, if you
please. The rufous tail in sharp contrast
to the olive brown head and back will
tell you his name every time, for he is
the only member of the thrush family
found in these regions in which the color
of the tail differs materially from that
of the back. I remember one afternoon
in February seeing one in the shade of
a thick-topped holly; here he remained
quite unconscious while we peered at
him through the opera glass, discussed
his coloring and consulted the pocket
manual to see what Chapman said about
him, an occasional jerk of the tail or a
slight movement of the head being the
only indication of life in the graceful
figure before us.</p>
<p>Late in March or early in April come
the purple martin, the bank swallow and
chimney swift, all cheerful birds whose
only apparent aim in life is to sail about
through the air in pursuit of gnats and
flies. The noisy chatter of the martins
as they wheel and turn about near the
house is one of the most agreeable sounds
in all the gamut of bird voices. They
are very numerous in parts of Mississippi,
but the only place in the North
where I have ever seen them in any considerable
numbers is on the Maumee,
not far from the little town of Waterville,
Ohio. The bank swallow and
chimney swift are smaller and less conspicuous
than the martin, less noisy but
quite as useful.</p>
<p>Soon after the swallows appear the
flycatchers, the tyrant wood pewee,
ph&oelig;be bird, Acadian and great crested.
What figure is more familiar on hot
summer days than the kingbird or tyrant
flycatcher perched on a mullein stalk, now
and then darting down from his perch
to capture some straying gnat? The
Acadian stops for only a very short
stay; you will find him in the deepest
shades, where the gloom and dampness
suit his somber fancy. The wood pewee
is also a gloomy soul, possessing no gift
of color or song to attract the eye or
hold the fancy; his long drawn out monotonous
note always reminds me of
hot August afternoons when all other
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
bird voices are silent as the grave and
summer reigns with undisputed sway.
The prince of woodland flycatchers, both
from point of coloring and attractive
personality, is the great crested; his olive
brown back, whitish breast and sulphur-yellow
belly give him a more brilliant
appearance than the others just mentioned.
His character, too, is better, for
he is neither as belligerent as the kingbird
or as gloomy as the Acadian and
wood pewee. His call is not unmelodious,
though it would be misleading to
call it a song.</p>
<p>April brings the orioles to play their
not insignificant part in the great color
scheme of Nature at this resurrection
season. I always associate the coming
of the orchard oriole with the opening
of the Chickasaw roses, and the arrival
of the Baltimore with the blooming of
the yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera).
For several seasons I caught my
first glimpse of the Baltimore&rsquo;s flame and
black in the top of a tall poplar, and
heard his cheery whistle as he dodged
in and out among the great cups, making
a breakfast on the insects whose
hum made the whole woods drowsy. A
few brief days of rest and pleasure in
this land of flowers and the orioles are
gone, except a few pairs that stay to
rear their families in these solitudes.</p>
<p>A long, slim, brown body, a stealthy
way of sliding in and out among the
vines and limbs, and a shy, suspicious
air mark the black billed cuckoo or raincrow.
He, too, stays but a few days.
When you see the raincrow it is time
to look for the Wilson&rsquo;s thrush; but it
was never my privilege to hear him sing
in these forests. Perhaps he is tired out
with the long journey from the land of
eternal summer and wishes to be seen,
not heard. Writers tell us that this
thrush is very plentiful in certain localities,
but in this section of the South I
saw only two specimens in four years.</p>
<p>The musician of the thrush family, of
the whole woods for that matter, in some
points a successful rival of the mocking
bird, is the wood thrush. Dark cinnamon
brown, of quite a uniform tint above
and white breast spotted with round,
black, or dark brown enable one to pick
him out easily from the rest of the
thrush family. I remember hearing one
sing at a negro &ldquo;baptizing&rdquo; just at sunset
of an April day. After the immersion
had taken place, as the officiating
&ldquo;elder&rdquo; led the candidate to the bank of
the pond, clear negro voices raised one
of the good old hymns. As the words
of the last verse died away on the evening
air and the elder raised his hand
to pronounce the benediction, a wood
thrush in the nearby forest began his
vespers. Sweet, clear as a silver bell,
the notes arose, tinkling, reverberating,
tender but dignified, voicing in a half-unconscious
way the solemn emotions of
the hour. What is there in the singing
of even the best of trained choirs to compare
with this simple voice of Nature,
without affectation or conceit, arousing
the feelings and appealing to the noblest
instincts of our common nature.</p>
<p>Birds crowd in upon us, bull bat,
chuck-wills-widow, turtle dove, gray-cheeked
thrush and titlark come to see
us, some to stop and add their own individual
element to the local coloring,
others after a few hours of rest to continue
their way northward. Multitudes
of sparrows, jays, thrashers, nuthatches,
titmice, woodpeckers, etc., that have enjoyed
our hospitality during the winter
and part of the spring pack up their
effects and leave, for summer is almost
here.</p>
<p>The bird that to my mind is distinctly
the advance agent of summer has well
been called the summer tanager. He delays
his coming until straw hats and linen
suits appear; then what a dash of warm
color he brings. Seated on the topmost
bough of a tall oak, where the sun&rsquo;s
rays fall full upon him, he gives such
intense, palpitating color that one&rsquo;s eyes
are almost blinded looking at him. Rich
as is the red of the cardinal it appears
soiled and tarnished beside the summer
tanager.</p>
<p>With a sigh we realize that the spring
migration is over for this year; but there
is one consolation, only a part of its
music is hushed&mdash;the soul of Southern
bird life, the mocking bird, is left. Inconspicuous
by reason of his Quaker-gray
suit, he makes up in attractive manners
and variety of musical gifts what he lacks
in other respects. It is quite impossible
to do justice to this bird either in describing
his bubbling, effervescent life
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
during the nesting season or in giving
an adequate idea of the effect produced
upon the senses by his exquisitely beautiful
nocturnes. One March night some
noise just outside my window awakened
me. I arose and raising the window
listened. The full moon, almost in the
zenith, was flooding the landscape with
a weird, soft light; the shadows of the
cedar hedge a few yards away lay black
as ink; the very air was heavy with the
perfume of the jessamine abloom in a
neighboring forest. In the cedars a mocking
bird sang to himself a sweet, dreamy
song, giving more complete expression
to the mystery, the romance, the passion,
the rapturous content of a Southern
moonlit night than any poem that poet&rsquo;s
hand has ever written.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">James Stephen Compton.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="c24">ANTICS OF A HUMMINGBIRD.</h2>
<p>As the writer was standing one May
morning near a clump of bushes in the
suburbs of a city in Maine he witnessed,
for the first time in a long experience of
bird study, the courting antics of a male
hummingbird. Two of the tiny creatures
appeared, apparently evolved from mid-air,
and one alighted in the bush. She
was the female. The male immediately
began to disport himself in the air in the
following remarkable manner:</p>
<p>He dashed back and forth over the
head of the female in long, curving
swoops such as one describes in a swing,
all the time giving utterance to a low,
pleasing twitter. He thus swept back
and forth ten times, rising at the ends
of the curve to a height of perhaps fifteen
feet, sustaining himself there a moment,
with his ruby throat flashing in
the sun, and then darting down the double
toboggan slide and up to the other
end. Though he flew very swiftly, yet
his speed was not the usual flash and
his movements could be plainly seen. I
had never before seen a hummingbird
fly so slowly nor heard from one of them
such a prolonged vocal sound. Indeed,
it is very rare that one hears the hummingbird&rsquo;s
voice, even if one is on the
alert for it. After the tenth swoop there
was a buzz of wings and both birds had
vanished. A minute after I found the
male in a cherry tree sipping honey from
the blossoms.</p>
<p>There is evidently a rivalry between
the bees and the hummingbirds in their
quest for honey. This bird, with an angry
dash, expressed its disapproval of
the presence of a big bumblebee in the
same tree. The usually pugnacious bee
incontinently fled, but he did not leave
the tree. He dashed back and forth
among the branches and white blossoms,
the hummingbird in close pursuit.
Where will you find another pair
that could dodge and turn and
dart equal to these? They were
like flashes of light, yet the pursuer
followed in the track of the pursued,
turning when the bee turned. There
was no cutting across, for there was no
time for that. In short, the bird and the
bee controlled the movement of their
bodies more quickly and more accurately
than the writer could control the movement
of his eyes. The chase was all over
in half the time that it has taken to tell
it, but the excitement of a pack of hounds
after a fox is as nothing, in comparison.
The bee escaped, the bird giving up the
chase and alighting on a twig. It couldn&rsquo;t
have been chasing the bee for food, and
there is no possible explanation of its
unprovoked attack except that it wished
to have all the honey itself. So even as
little a body as a hummingbird can show
selfishness in a marked degree. However,
Mr. Bee continued to take his share
of Nature&rsquo;s bounty, though doubtless he
had his weather eye open against another
attack. Both scenes afforded me a delightful
study and were a rare privilege.</p>

<p>Acorus calamus, commonly known as
Calamus, sweet flag and cinnamon sedge,
is a reed-like plant common in Europe
and Northern United States. It grows
in swamps, marshes and very moist
places. It is a herbaceous perennial
growing from spreading fleshy rhizomes.
The long, sword-like, deep green, pointed
leaves grow up from the rhizomes.</p>
<p>The history of this plant dates back
to remote antiquity, yet there is considerable
uncertainty as regards the identity
of the various plants which have at various
periods been supposed to be sweet
flag. There is no doubt that some reedlike
plant in many respects similar if
not identical with calamus was used by
the ancient Egyptians in the preparation
of incense as recorded in the papyri of
Ebers. These Egyptian records date back
to the eighteenth dynasty, or from 1800
to 2000 years B. C. Vague references to
a similar plant are to be found in the
ancient sacred writings of the Hindoos.
It is likely that the plant referred to and
that which is mentioned in the Bible is
a species of Andropogon, and not
Acorus. In Exodus, 30:23, we find:
&ldquo;Take thou also unto thee principal
spices of pure myrrh, of sweet cinnamon,
and of sweet Calamus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our first reliable information of Calamus
is from Plinius, who received specimens
from the country about the Black
Sea and who described it under the name
of Acorus calamus. Acorus, derived
from the Greek a for, and corus, the eye,
because the plant was highly recommended
in the treatment of diseases of the
eye. Calamus, also derived from the
Greek, means a reed or reed-like plant.
Dioscorides and Theophrastus also describe
the plant with special reference to
the rhizome and its uses.</p>
<p>The rhizomes should be collected late
in the autumn, carefully cleaned of dirt,
leaf remnants, leaf scales and roots and
dried in the sun or in an oven at a moderate
temperature. The aromatic odor
increases greatly on drying.</p>
<p>Calamus has ever been a favorite popular
remedy. Its principal use seems to
have been that of a tonic and blood purifier,
for which purpose bits of the dried
rhizomes are masticated and the saliva
swallowed. It undoubtedly is a tonic
and it also has a beneficial, stimulating
and antiseptic effect upon gums and
teeth. Chewing the rhizomes is also said
to clear the voice. Calamus is, or has
been, used in flavoring beer and gin.
Country, people add it to whisky, wine
and brandy to make a tonic bitters for
the weak and dyspeptic. It is said that
the Turks employ it as a preventive
against contagious diseases. In India it
is used to destroy vermin, especially fleas.
In England it is employed in the treatment
of malaria.</p>
<p>At the present time Calamus is no
longer extensively employed in medicine.
It is considered as a stimulating, aromatic
and bitter tonic. It is perhaps true that
its value as a tonic is at present somewhat
underestimated by the medical profession.
It is also serviceable in flatulent
colic, and in what is designated as
atonic dyspepsia. It is added to other
medicines, either as a corrective, or adjuvant.</p>
